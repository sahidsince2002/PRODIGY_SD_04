# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking and Recursion

This is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking and recursion. It employs a simple yet efficient algorithm to find the solution for any given Sudoku puzzle.

## How it Works

The solver uses a backtracking algorithm combined with recursion to solve the Sudoku puzzle. Here's how it works:

1. **Find an empty cell:** The solver starts by finding an empty cell (a cell with the value 0) in the Sudoku grid. If no empty cell is found, the puzzle is considered solved.

2. **Try possible numbers:** For the empty cell found in step 1, the solver tries filling it with numbers from 1 to 9, one by one.

3. **Check if the number is valid:** After filling the cell with a number, the solver checks if the number violates any Sudoku rules (no duplicate numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).

4. **Recursion:** If the number is valid, the solver recursively tries to fill the remaining empty cells. If it reaches a dead end (no valid numbers left to fill), it backtracks and tries a different number for the current cell.

5. **Repeat:** The process continues until the entire Sudoku puzzle is solved.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the Solver:** Run the `sudoku_solver.py` file with Python. You can provide the Sudoku puzzle as input in the form of a 9x9 grid with 0 representing empty cells. For example:
   
   ```bash
   python sudoku_solver.py < puzzle.txt
